## 🧠 Project Overview

- Developed a binary classification model to predict whether a loan will be repaid.
- Built using:
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn
  - SckitLearn
  - TensorFlow / Keras
 
**RepayAI** is a deep learning-based binary classification model designed to predict whether a borrower will repay a loan or default, using real-world data from Lending Club.

The goal is to assist financial institutions and credit analysts in making more informed lending decisions by identifying high-risk applicants based on historical loan patterns.

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and interpretation.


- Achieved:
  - ✅ **96% accuracy**
  - ✅ **99% precision** for repaid loans
  - ✅ **89% recall** for defaulters
